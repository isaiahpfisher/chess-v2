# Chess
### Info
- This is my first somewhat significant web development project. It was derived from a [C++ version](https://github.com/isaiahpfisher/chess-console) made with [Jaxen Roden](https://github.com/jaxenroden).
- The project is Vanilla JS and styled with Tailwind.
- It was bootstrapped with Vite and deployed with Vercel.
### Features
- Drag and drop user interface.
- Customizable themes.
- Comprehensive chess gameplay (en passant, castling, pawn promotion, etc.)
- Lists the captured pieces and displays a move history.
- Toggle between 2-player and a semi-intelligent computer opponent (depth = 2).
